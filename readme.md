# Ekatra: A collection of resources at one place 

This project aims to spread STEM education among girls. One of the main reasons behind girls not choosing science is <mark>lack of guidance</mark> and the belief that it is meant only for boys. 

This is the main idea about the topic of making STEM education accessible to girls.

Through this website, I aim to build a collection that is reliable, of open and free resources of all subjects related to engineering- including maths, chemistry, physics, computer science and in future dynamic subjects like space, blockchain <mark> all at one place </mark>, all <mark> free of cost</mark> and <mark> without any requirement to login or register</mark>, acknowledging the fact that girls from remote areas might have very limited access to resources to access the online content. 

Most of the website today require at least a email account to login in order to access its resources. This can be roadblock for girls from distant and remote areas with humble backgrounds who do no have enough technological knowledge to use those sites. Also, browsing through different sites take a lot of time, and the girls may have time constraints to access technological devices due to network problems at hilly and remote areas or single shared device at home. 
So,the site aims at providing all the content at one place that too openly, so that the girls can access it any time, at any place, without any criteria for logging in or creating account.


I have also incorporated a feature of notepad, in which one can add quick short notes or keep a tap of the incoming events. This can be used, in case one comes up with an idea or a solution and wants to write it down.

To sum up, the website is aimed at fecilitating as a open collection of resources including study material, important websites, possible job opprtunities. In future, I also look forward to incorporate a discussion platform.

```Due to time constraints, I was not able to implement the idea completely as researching and gathering reliable and required amount of resources was not possible. But I have created a framework for the website and that of the notepad too, as a brief about how the website will function.```
